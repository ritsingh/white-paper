The lack of a centralized, real-time marketplace leads to empty miles, missed opportunities, and idling trucks. On average, 20-30% of all truck miles are driven empty, significantly impacting revenue opportunities​ (Inbound Logistics)​​ (Export and Freight)​. This issue is compounded by the ever-changing regulatory landscape, forcing carriers to expend time and resources reconfirming route compliance with each new shipment type.\n\nSuboptimal Routes: HazMat route restrictions require specialized expertise. Carriers often rely on generic route planners designed for standard cargo, resulting in 15-20% longer routes, increased fuel costs, and the potential for non-compliance – all negatively impacting earnings​ (Fleet Point)​.\n\nDelayed Payments: Opaque pricing structures and lengthy invoicing processes can lead to cash flow issues. Around 40% of carriers report experiencing payment delays, which hampers their ability to operate, invest in their fleet, and retain drivers​ (Inbound Logistics)​​ (Fleet Point)​.'

This makes it difficult to optimize routes, match the right loads to carriers, and ultimately maximize earning potential across the dispatch network. Around 55% of dispatchers struggle with fragmented data management​ (Inbound Logistics)​​ (Fleet Point)​.\n\nCompliance Headaches: Ensuring drivers have current certifications and that vehicles meet HazMat standards adds a layer of administrative complexity.
