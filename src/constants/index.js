This issue is compounded by the ever-changing regulatory landscape, forcing carriers to expend time and resources reconfirming route compliance with each new shipment type.\n\nSuboptimal Routes: HazMat route restrictions require specialized expertise. Carriers often rely on generic route planners designed for standard cargo, resulting in 15-20% longer routes, increased fuel costs, and the potential for non-compliance – all negatively impacting earnings​ (Fleet Point)​.\n\nDelayed Payments: Opaque pricing structures and lengthy invoicing processes can lead to cash flow issues.

Around 55% of dispatchers struggle with fragmented data management​ (Inbound Logistics)​​ (Fleet Point)​.\n\nCompliance Headaches: Ensuring drivers have current certifications and that vehicles meet HazMat standards adds a layer of administrative complexity.
